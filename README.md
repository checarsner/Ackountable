#### Why Ackountable
With so many to-do list apps out there why use Ackountable? I wanted to come up with a way that someone could set and achieve goals by putting skin in the game AND picking a person to hold them accountable that they wouldn't dare let down. We're using the eCash blockchain to hold our info so that we can also pass value back and fourth and avoid using database systems. This project will be used via IPFS.
